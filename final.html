            I do know that time flies so fast. But since from the time we have started our journey, the time I
            have spent untill now was really meaningful. I do know that every time I am with you, the way you make me
            realize the reason to keep moving forward,the way you make me feel relax from the stress and the worries, I
            do really appreciate for everything and I do promise you one thing that I will never forget the beginning. I
            do love you bae. And I will always try to keep my love for you for good. I wish you have another happy
            anniversary. Chit tl kaly"
